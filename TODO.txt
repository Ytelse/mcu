==== MCU TODO LIST ====

* Test data correctness of data transferred from FPGA to MCU
	- Perhaps transfer numbers from 0 to (2^16)-1 and read through
	  output checking for any missing numbers. If we do this over several
	  MB of data we should find discrepancies if they exist.

* Add documentation for entire codebase!
	- Not necessary to explain how everything works (only if it does something very hacky)
	  but ensure that every function has a line or two about _what_ it does.

* TODO: Add more TODO items to this list.
