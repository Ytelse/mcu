==== MCU TODO LIST ====

* Test interrupt-driven MCU <-> FPGA communication
	- See GPIO_ODD_IRQHandler in src/main.c for details

* Fix MSTATE implementation.
	- Accessing CPU register is so far unsuccessful.
		- Unsure if it is worth trying further for minuscule performance gain
	- See mstate.h in both include/ and mcu_fpga_test/include for details

* Implement the USB callback functions properly
	- Data read callback:
		- Set MSTATE flags according to data received from USB host
	- Data sent callback:
		- Set MSTATE flags denoting buffer availability
	- State changed callback:
		- Set MSTATE flags?
		- Set LEDs?

* Add documentation for entire codebase!
	- Not necessary to explain how everything works (only if it does something very hacky)
	  but ensure that every functions has a line or two about _what_ it does.

* TODO: Add more TODO items to this list.
